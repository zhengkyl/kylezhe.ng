            <p>
            Collaborated on a mood tracker app based on the open source DeepMoji sentiment analysis model. 
            I worked on transforming and presenting emoji sentiment data using React Native chart libraries. Used breakdowns of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment to estimate and graph relative mood.
